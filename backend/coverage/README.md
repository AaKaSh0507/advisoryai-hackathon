# Coverage Directory

This directory contains test coverage reports generated by pytest-cov.

## Files

- `test_coverage.txt` - Text-based coverage report (auto-generated on each test run)
- `html/` - HTML coverage report (browse `index.html` for detailed view)

## Generating Coverage Reports

Run from the `backend/` directory:

```bash
# Run tests with coverage (using pyproject.toml settings)
python -m pytest tests/

# Or explicitly specify coverage options
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=app --cov-report=txt:coverage/test_coverage.txt --cov-report=html:coverage/html
```

## Viewing Reports

- **Text report**: `cat coverage/test_coverage.txt`
- **HTML report**: Open `coverage/html/index.html` in a browser

## Coverage Thresholds

Currently no minimum coverage threshold is enforced. To add one, update `--cov-fail-under` in `pyproject.toml`.
